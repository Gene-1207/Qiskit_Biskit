# Qiskit_Biskit
## Aim :
Building a fully functional BB84 Quantum Key Distribution system using Qiskit. 

The project generates a shared secret key between two parties(Alice and Bob), performs basis sifting, estimates the error rate to detect eavesdropping, and measures how noise affects protocol performance.
